# program-showcase
a short showcase of a few programs ive made

hotelgp program, 
imagine a hotel with x no. of rooms, and at the front desk counter, some guests would like to check in.
this program helps the counter in-charge find an empty room with a press of a button, allows input for the number of guests checked in, and updates the file accordingly.
the next program displays a simple GUI jframe for the counter in-charge to check the no. of guests in each room(input room no.) and displays(output), the no of guests in that room.
