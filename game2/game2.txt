A simple game where characters can be created and used to battle each other with Moves. 

Highlights: 
uses ByteStream to store Moves, specifically with the RandomAccessFile object. 
Moves indexed using an Index object, which has a fixed byte length, which then provides the offset of the corresponding actual Moves object
such that the Characters can choose which Moves to be added/'learned'.
